Hamiltonian of FP&amp;EB molecules in a phosphorene monolayer
Machine learning combined with quantum chemical based on first-principles density functional theory (DFT). 
An efficient four machine learning models to accelerate the prediction of Hamiltonian and non-bond energy is provide for EB, FP, and hybrid FP-EB molecules on BP nanocarrier, namely Bagged Trees, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Regression Trees (RT) as included in Matlab package R2021b. Based on training data, we calibrated the machine learning models using Bayesian optimization.
Training efficient and accurate models for approximating DFT is the final step in using machine learning to gain more insight in the design of new drugs.
