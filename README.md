# MD-ML-Hamiltonian
Hamiltonian of FP&amp;EB molecules in a phosphorene monolayer using 
machine learning combined with quantum chemical based on first-principles density functional theory (DFT). 
An efficient four machine learning models to accelerate the prediction of Hamiltonian and non-bond energy is provide for ebselen (EB),  favipiravir (FP), and hybrid FP-EB molecules on BP nanocarrier, namely Bagged Trees, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Regression Trees (RT) as included in Matlab package R2021b (https://www.mathworks.com/). Based on training data, we calibrated the machine learning models using Bayesian optimization.
Training efficient and accurate models for approximating DFT is the final step in using machine learning to gain more insight in the design of new drugs.
The data contains the geometry structure of all the configurations in the studied, all Cartesian coordinate of favipiravir and ebselen molecules on black-phosphoros are stored in CONTCAR format, as well as the properties extracted from the DFT calculations which was carried out with VASP program (https://www.vasp.at/). It is also includes the high-throughput vaspkit code (https://vaspkit.com/) related to thermodynamic results, the  results from the thermodynamical analysis performed with vaspkit is pointed out (data-Figure 9 and 10.xlsx).
